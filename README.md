FastGPT is a Chrome extension that adds functionality to ChatGPT conversations. The extension allows the user to use the up/down arrows on their keyboard to navigate the prompts. 
Basically, when a user hits the up arrow, the screen will travel to have the nearest prompt above the current one in the center of the screen, and vice versa for the down arrow. This alone makes
navigating the prompts much easier, because it saves you from having to scroll and search for them. In addition, the user can hit ctrl + s to open an overlay consisting of all of the prompts they
sent in that chat log. They can scroll through those and click on one and the screen will close the overlay and travel to that specific prompt. Download the extension now for free @
